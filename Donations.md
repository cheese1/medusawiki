**Do You Like SickRage?**  
Than please consider a donation to help us cover the costs and securing the future of SickRage.  

The SickRage team consists of **volunteers**, who are offering a lot of their free time to keep this amazing project running. Donations are not required, but are appreciated. (They help us convince our wives that all of the time we spend on GitHub is worthwhile, which allows us to continue improving SickRage.:) )

However there are more ways to help. If you are familiar with Python, HTML, Javascript, graphics design, or other languages, please give a shout. Also if you have experience moderating and want to help users solving/answering basic questions regarding SickRage, you are more than welcome.
